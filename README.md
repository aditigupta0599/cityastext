# Roads Are Read, Buildings Blue: Urban Morphology Meets Deep Learning
## The main goal of this project is to see how it is possible to learn hierarchies of urban patterns, using the so called "representation learning" methods such as convolutional neural networks and a big collection of images of more than 75K cities across the world .  
* **Keywords: Urban Morphology, Big Data, Deep Learning, Hierarchical Representation, ....**

* **Dot map of the centers of more than 1.1 million cities, towns and villages, extracted from OSM planet (all to be used in the next experiments)**
